# fetch-GST-details-without-using-any-paid-API

This is kind of a hacky way to get GST details without paying for the third party APIs. I used developer tools to analyse how Indian govt's GST details fetching works and created a small service for it, wasn't that starightforward as well, had to figure out bypassing their captcha and much more.  

I'm sharing the functions/module that I used in my Nest.js based service, it should be quite straight forward for you to integrate in your code/service.
